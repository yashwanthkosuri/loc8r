### <span id='fullstackdevelopment'>What Does Fullstack Development Mean?</span>
When we talk about full-stack development, we’re really talking about **developing all parts of a website or application.** The full stack starts with the _database_ and
_web server_ in the back end, contains _application logic_ and _control_ in the middle, and goes all the way through to the _user interface_ at the front end.

The MEAN stack is a pure JavaScript stack comprised of four main technologies, with a cast of supporting technologies:
- **M**ongoDB—the database
- **E**xpress—the web framework
- **A**ngular—the front-end framework
- **N**ode.js—the web server
